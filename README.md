# CLang game dev

The main purpose of this project is to inspire more people to use C programming language for their Game Dev projects, and to help newcomers and beginner programmers learn C language in a more engaging manner.

#### The following libraries are used:
- Raylib

#### Game resources (music, textures, images, etc...)
All of the game resources are either made by myself or downloaded from the internet under 'copyright free' lisence. All of the credits go to their respective creators. 

#### Software used
I do not use any of the IDEs. Terminal, GCC compiler and Sublime Text Editor have been the best companions in this journey. 

Enjoy!
